RISC Chip
=========

RISC Chip is an electronic music project by Mike Hodnick under the "Kindohm" 
artist moniker. It was made with the TidalCycles live-coding pattern environment 
(based in Haskell). 

The album will be released December 15, 2016 on the [Conditional](http://conditional.club) label.
It is available in both digital and 12" Vinyl formats at 
[shop.conditional.club/album/risc-chip](http://shop.conditional.club/album/risc-chip).

## Production With TidalCycles

_RISC Chip_ was composed, produced, and performed using the [TidalCycles](http://tidalcycles.org)
live-coding pattern environment. If you wish to use this source code, you must install
TidalCycles first.  

> TidalCycles (or Tidal for short) is a language for live coding pattern. It allows you to make 
> musical patterns with text, describing sequences and ways of transforming and combining them, 
> exploring complex interactions between simple parts.

<a name="samples"></a>
## Audio Samples

Audio samples are in the [samples](tree/master/samples) folder. They are structured in a way
that is compatible with the TidalCycles environment. **Note**: samples were used only for the
tracks [RISC Chip](https://github.com/kindohm/risc-chip/blob/master/tracks/04.RISC-Chip.tidal), 
[Bit Dust](https://github.com/kindohm/risc-chip/blob/master/tracks/05.Bit-Dust.tidal), and
[Viewport](https://github.com/kindohm/risc-chip/blob/master/tracks/06.Viewport.tidal)
(all other tracks used live synthesizers with MIDI).

## Visuals

Visuals for one track were created by [Shawn Lawson](https://github.com/shawnlawson) (Obi-Wan Codenobi) for the album release date. [The Force](https://github.com/shawnlawson/The_Force) was used live-code the visuals.

## Nerdy Production Notes

All tracks recorded from live-running TidalCycles patterns with live hardware over tidal-midi or one-shot samples.

Writing and production of _RISC Chip_ began on June 10, 2016 with the
creation of [Pattern 454](https://github.com/kindohm/365tidalpatterns/blob/master/patterns-401-500/pattern454.tidal) 
from the _365 Tidal Patterns_ project. Production lasted until August 30, 2016.

All sounds were sourced from the following analog hardware[1]: 

* Elektron Analog RYTM
* Dreadbox Erebus
* Korg Minilogue
* Korg Volca Keys

Writing and recording was primarily done from TidalCycles MIDI. Patterns
were executed and recorded in real time with live synths. Exceptions 
are on _RISC Chip_ and _Bit Dust_ which used one-shot samples extracted from 
patterned synth recordings.

[1] Two tracks contain content not sourced from the above hardware: 
1) _RISC Chip_ (vocal samples) and 2) _Viewport_ (which is a remix of the track 
_Ring Surfing_ from 
[Expedition](https://kindohm.bandcamp.com/album/expedition) album).
